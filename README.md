Gensyn Protocol – Decentralized AI Compute Infrastructure

What is Gensyn?
Gensyn is a Layer-1 blockchain protocol designed to power trustless deep learning computation. It rewards users for providing compute power and enables smart contract-based task distribution, verification, and payments — all in a decentralized AI network.

Key Features:

Decentralized Compute Network:
Gensyn links machine learning hardware from around the world into a unified, decentralized supercluster. This lets users tap into global GPU and CPU resources, without relying on centralized cloud providers.

Layer-1 Trustless Architecture:
Gensyn is its own blockchain. It uses cryptographic methods to verify computation and allow untrusted parties to collaborate securely and transparently.

Cost Efficiency:
No need for expensive cloud infrastructure. Gensyn uses a peer-to-peer network with a pay-as-you-go model — making AI training and inference more affordable.

Scalability:
Built to handle large models, Gensyn splits workloads across the network — improving speed and efficiency.

Verde Verification System:
“Verde” ensures computations done on untrusted nodes are accurate — solving one of the biggest problems in decentralized ML.

Access for Everyone:
Developers and researchers can train AI models without needing to invest in expensive hardware — making AI accessible to all.

Cutting-Edge Research:
Gensyn’s team is working on:

SkipPipe: Communication-efficient decentralized training

Diverse Expert Ensembles: Parallel LLM training using new MoE (Mixture of Experts) architectures
